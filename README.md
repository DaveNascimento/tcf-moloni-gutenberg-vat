# WooCommerce Gutenberg Checkout VAT field for Moloni

Adds a Moloni-compatible VAT field to the WooCommerce Checkout Gutenberg billing fields block, since their own plugin doesn't support the new WordPress editor.

Either upload the plugin to the wp-content/plugins directory, or add it via the Plugins - Add Plugin menu in the WordPress admin.

## Development

Open any text editor and have fun coding!
